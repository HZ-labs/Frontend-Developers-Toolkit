Frontend-Developers-Toolkit
===========================

A resource collecting a suite of useful tools and technologies for front end web development.

###Boilerplates

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) - the professional frontend developers's base HTML/CSS/JS template for a fast, robust and future-safe site.
* [320andup](https://github.com/malarkey/320andup) - the &lsquo;tiny screen first&rsquo; responsive boilerplate.
* [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) - An easy to use, powerful, and flexible framework for building prototypes and production code on any kind of device.

###CSS Preprocessors

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - an extension of CSS3, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more.
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) - works with Sass to bring you standarised mixins and advanced tools (including auto spriting!).
* [Less](http://lesscss.org/) - LESS extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions. Runs on client and server sides.
* [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) - Expressive, robust, feature-rich CSS language built for nodejs.

###Javascript Frameworks

A excellent list of javascript frameworks is maintained over at [www.remotesynthesis.com](http://remotesynthesis.com/skins/remotesynthesis/jsFrameworks.cfm).

###Javascript Unit Testing
* [QUnit](http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit) - QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use, JavaScript test suite. It's used by the jQuery project to test its code and plugins but is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code (and even capable of testing JavaScript code on the server-side).
* [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) - Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing your JavaScript code.

###Process automation
* [Grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) - a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.
* [Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) - a gui interface which helps you work faster by combining Sass, Minifaction, Image Compression, Live Reload, JSHint/Lint and much more!


###Responsive Images

* [Foresight.js](https://github.com/adamdbradley/foresight.js) - tell if the user's device is capable of viewing high-resolution images and judge if the user's device currently has a fast enough network connection to receive them.
* [Responsive Images](https://github.com/filamentgroup/Responsive-Images) - deliver optimized, contextual image sizes in responsive layouts that utilize dramatically different image sizes at different resolutions.
* [AdaptiveImages](https://github.com/mattwilcox/Adaptive-Images) - a solution to automatically create, cache, and deliver device-appropriate versions of your websiteâ€™s content images. It does not require you to change your mark-up.

###Charts & Graphing

* [Envision](http://www.humblesoftware.com/envision/) - a library for creating fast, dynamic and interactive HTML5 visualizations.
* [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) - interactive charts and data tools based on SVG and HTML5.
* [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) - advanced visualisation JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. 
* [Crossfilter](http://square.github.com/crossfilter/) - not strictly a charting library, but rather a JavaScript library for exploring large multivariate datasets in the browser. Works well with d3.js.



###Misc Tools & Bookmarklets

* [Entity Lookup](http://leftlogic.com/projects/entity-lookup) - allows you to quickly find the HTML entity based on how it looks.
* [Media Query Bookmarklet](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/media_query_bookmarklet) - shows which Media Queries are currently active on your page inline and in realtime.
