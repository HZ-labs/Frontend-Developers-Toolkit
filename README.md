Frontend-Developers-Toolkit
===========================

A resource collecting a suite of useful tools and technologies for front end web development.

###Responsive Images

* [Foresight.js](https://github.com/adamdbradley/foresight.js?utm_source=html5weekly) - tell if the user's device is capable of viewing high-resolution images and judge if the user's device currently has a fast enough network connection to receive them.
* [Responsive Images](https://github.com/filamentgroup/Responsive-Images) - deliver optimized, contextual image sizes in responsive layouts that utilize dramatically different image sizes at different resolutions.
* [AdaptiveImages](https://github.com/mattwilcox/Adaptive-Images) - a solution to automatically create, cache, and deliver device-appropriate versions of your websiteâ€™s content images. It does not require you to change your mark-up.

###Charts & Graphing

* [Envision](http://www.humblesoftware.com/envision/) - a library for creating fast, dynamic and interactive HTML5 visualizations.
* [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) - interactive charts and data tools based on SVG and HTML5.
* [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) - advanced visualisation JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. 
* [Crossfilter](http://square.github.com/crossfilter/) - not strictly a charting library, but rather a JavaScript library for exploring large multivariate datasets in the browser. Works well with d3.js.



###Misc Tools & Bookmarklets

* [Entity Lookup](http://leftlogic.com/projects/entity-lookup) - allows you to quickly find the HTML entity based on how it looks.
* [Media Query Bookmarklet](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/media_query_bookmarklet) - shows which Media Queries are currently active on your page inline and in realtime.
